# Developing Locally

This repository is set up as a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). It includes some custom setup for my own infrastructure that is commented out.

See `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` to enable Traefik routing. 

Upon cloning the repository, copy `.env.example` to `server/.env` and customize as needed. 

There are VSCode Tasks set up to launch the client and server together. CTRL + SHIFT + P and then look for Run Tasks and choose Watch All.
